ALEXReaderWriterAccess
======================

An Objective-C category on NSObject that allows concurrent access to a mutable object from different queues. It adds methods like `-alex_performReadBlock:` and `alex_performWriteBlock:` that are used the same way to access the object as the similar methods on NSManagedObjectContexts of a queue concurrency type.
